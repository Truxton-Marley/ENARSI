# Introduction

This program is designed to assist in learning and implementing the IOS commands needed to pass the Cisco ENARSI exam.

It is in no way intended to replace labbing, but to supplement it by giving a curated run through of commands to assist in building muscle memory.

Anyone who has finished the ENCOR exam should have enough Python to be able to add or change questions as needed or to adjust the question flow to their liking.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to implement an auto-complete feature yet, so the full commands will need to be given.

# Conventions

All usage of the term "interface" on the cli have been shortened to "int". Interface names use the first three letters in lower case followed by a space and the port number.

AS numbers are generally 42 with a few exceptions.

Anywhere a username and password are required, the standard "admin" and "cisco123" have been used. You should of course never use these in production.

# Running the program

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Download the code, cd to directory and run the "main.py" file using Python 3. It's as simple as that.
